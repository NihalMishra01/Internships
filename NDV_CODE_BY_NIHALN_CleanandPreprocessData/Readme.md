# Netflix or IPL Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

## Objective
This project cleans and preprocesses the Netflix  dataset using Pandas and NumPy for data analysis and ML-readiness.

## Steps
- Loaded dataset with Pandas
- Inspected for missing values and data types
- Handled missing data using fill/drop strategies
- Removed duplicate records
- Corrected data types
- Applied numerical transformations with NumPy
- Filtered, sorted, and grouped data using Pandas
- Visualized missing value distributions (heatmaps) and correlation matrices
- Label encoded categorical columns for ML-readiness

## Findings
- Dataset had missing values in ['director', 'cast'] columns.
- Duplicates removed successfully.
- Heatmap showed sparse missing data in some columns.
- Correlation matrix provided insights for numeric features.

## Results
- Cleaned dataset saved as `cleaned_dataset.csv`
- Ready for ML/EDA tasks.
