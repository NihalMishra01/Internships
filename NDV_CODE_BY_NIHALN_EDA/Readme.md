# Titanic Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This notebook performs an extensive EDA on the Titanic dataset to uncover patterns, gain insights into passenger survival, and visualize relationships between features.

## Key Steps
- Load and clean the Titanic dataset
- Handle missing values and correct data types
- Generate descriptive statistics (`describe()`, `info()`, `value_counts()`)
- Visualize:
  - Distributions of numerical and categorical features
  - Pair plots and correlation heatmaps
  - Survival rates across gender, class, and embarkation
- Feature engineering (e.g., `FamilySize`)
- Bonus: Violin plots and top 5 insights in markdown

## Dataset
- Titanic dataset from Kaggle

## Running the Notebook
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies:
