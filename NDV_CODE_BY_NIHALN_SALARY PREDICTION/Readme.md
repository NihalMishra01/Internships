# Salary Prediction using Linear Regression

This project uses a simple linear regression model to predict salary based on years of experience from a dataset that includes:
- Age
- Gender
- Education Level
- Job Title
- Years of Experience
- Salary

## 📌 Steps
1. Data loaded and cleaned using Pandas
2. Relationship visualized using Seaborn
3. Linear Regression applied using Scikit-learn
4. Evaluated using MSE and R²
5. Bonus: Error bars, bar chart comparison, and user input for prediction
